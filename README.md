# DenseFusion-with-sphercial-convolution-encoder

6D pose estimation method developed during a master course. 
This method is based on the architecture of the DenseFusion method with the addition of a spherical convolution based encoder inspired by the DualPoseNet method.

As well as a tool to visualise the installation in the form of a video on the YCB database.
